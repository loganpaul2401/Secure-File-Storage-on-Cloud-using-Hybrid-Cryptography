# Secure-File-Storage-on-Cloud-using-Hybrid-Cryptography-
In cloud computing, data is stored, managed, and
backed up remotely before it is made available to
users online. When you store data in the cloud, you
don't have to set up and manage expensive and
complicated infrastructure to store and retrieve data
on-site. It's crucial in emergency situations as well.
The collection of storage servers in the system
makes it possible for it to offer a permanent online
backup solution [1]. When information is stored in
the cloud and a third party is in charge of it,
privacy concerns arise. Some generic encryption
algorithms in this cloud keep data private, but they
severely limit the storage system's abilities because
they can only be used for a small number of tasks.
Building a safe repository that can serve many
purposes is the primary goal of this work. Is
difficult when there is no centralized control over

the storage system. Using AES and proxy re-
encryption, it enables the feature of safe data

passing. At the first stage of this concept, the data
will be encrypted using AES by the owner. The
durability of stored information is crucial. Many
methods for archiving information on remote
servers have been proposed. Replicating a message
so that each storage server has a copy of the
message is one technique to make data more
reliable. Distributed storage systems are well-suited
to the use of a decentralized erasure code.

A simple approach to integration is used in the
existing system. A Simple Method of Integration
Concerns about data privacy is warranted when
using a cloud service provided by a third party. A
user may encrypt messages using a cryptographic
technique before applying an erasure code method
to encode and store messages in storage servers,
providing great secrecy for the communications.
He must first acquire the codeword symbols from
the storage servers, decode them, and then decrypt
those using cryptographic keys before he can
utilize the message. Although generic encryption
schemes provide data privacy, they restrict how the
data may be used since only certain actions can be
performed on encrypted information [4]. As a
storage server may join or leave a decentralized
architecture without being managed by a single
entity, it allows for greater scalability. Users have
more computational capacity, and data transfer
rates to and from storage servers are high. The user
is responsible for protecting his cryptographic keys.
Storage servers have a difficult time providing
direct support for other operations outside of data
storage and retrieval.
